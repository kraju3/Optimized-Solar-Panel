# Optimized-Solar-Panel-System
This system is made up of two hardware systems, the Positioning System (PS) and the Light Intensity System (LIS). The PS controls the orientation the solar panel is in, depending on which mode the system is in the control can be manual (user input) or automatic. When the system is in automatic mode it uses a software system, the Adjustment System (AS), to calculate how to reposition the PS. The AS makes it's decision based upon the light intensity values of the LIS.
