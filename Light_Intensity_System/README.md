The Light Intensity System (LIS) is the light intensity detection method for the solar panel. The LIS is made of five photosensitive sensor modules and sends their intensities as an instruction to the Driver. If the Driver is set to auto, these intensities will used to determine how to position the solar panel. An instruction is an instructionID followed by data members, all of these are delimited by a space " ".
